## Project Description

A portuguese bank did a marketing campaign via telecommunications promoting and offering term deposits for their clients. The campaign lasted a whole year and it was done by calling over 40,000 clients, either by telephone or their cellphones. The outcome though, was very poor, as more than 88% of the clients that were approached, said no to the term deposits.

The are two main goals in this project:
    - Generate insights and recommendations based on the campaign, to have a better outcome on the next one.
    - Predict which clients are accepting the Term Deposits and which clients are not, through machine learning models.

This is my final project for the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp. [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/en)

## Workflow

- Define the project and obtain the data.
- Understand the problem and the data available.
- Clean, organize and fill out data if necessary.
- Data visualization for better understanding and generate insights.
- Feature processing for machine learning application.
- Train the model.
- Validate the model.
- Tune Hyperparameters.
- Present the Project.


## Questions

- Were the strategies used in the last campaign effective?
- Which age group should the bank approach on the next campaign to have a better outcome?
- Should the bank target clients with high balances or low balances?
- What is the occupation of those clients that accepted the term deposit?
- When is the best time of the year to approach the clients?
- What are the most important features a classifier needs to make an accurate prediction?
- Which machine learning classifier has the best performance in predicting the outcome of the next campaign?
